The assignment is to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a Pokemon species hierarchy program in Java.   

## What is GUI? 
A graphic user interface (GUI) is a tool for people to interact with a computer utilizing visual components like buttons, text fields, and windows. When compared to using command-line input and output, this technique is more user-friendly. The Swing library is one of several Java libraries that may be used to create graphical user interface (GUI) applications. These libraries include a large variety of components and are highly helpful for developing visual programs.


## What I learned from this project
Through this project, I've learned a lot about creating a 2D frame using a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a crucial ability for making user-friendly applications. I used a variety of in-class methods to increase the program's interactivity and enjoyment. For instance, sorting the caught and encountered Pokemon—a major part of the program—was accomplished using data structures like stack and priority queue. Through this project, I've learned how to differentiate between various data formats and apply sorting strategies efficiently. It has also improved my ability to create GUIs.
