The assignment is to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a Pokemon species hierarchy program in Java .  

## What is GUI? 
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a visual interface that allows you to interact with a computer by using visual components such as buttons, text fields, and windows. In contrast to utilizing command-line input and output, this gives a more user-friendly approach to utilizing the software. Java has a number of libraries, such as the Swing library, that may be used to construct GUI applications. These libraries include a broad range of components, and they are really useful for developing visual applications.

## What I learned from this project
From this project, I have learned how to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to create a 2D frame, which is an essential skill for creating user-friendly programs. I used several techniques I acquired in class to make the program more engaging and fun. For example, data structures like as the stack and priority queue are used to sort the captured and met Pokemon, which is a core part of the program. Working on the project has taught me how to successfully construct sorting techniques and differentiate between different data structures. It also improves my proficiency in GUI development.
