The assignment is to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a Pokemon species hierarchy program in Java .  

## What is GUI? 
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a way for users to interact with a computer using visual elements such as buttons, text fields, and windows. This approach is more user-friendly compared to using command-line input and output. Java has several libraries, like the Swing library, that can be used to develop GUI applications. These libraries offer a wide range of components and are very useful for creating visual programs.

## What I learned from this project
Through this project, I have gained valuable knowledge in using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to create a 2D frame, which is an important skill for developing user-friendly programs. I applied various techniques learned in class to make the program more interactive and enjoyable. For instance, data structures like stack and priority queue were used to sort the captured and met Pokemon, which is a key aspect of the program. This project has taught me how to effectively implement sorting techniques and distinguish between different data structures. It has also enhanced my skills in GUI development.
