## About the project
Manoa Trade Your Stuff is a team project for ICS 314. The aim of this project is to establish a marketplace that facilitates the buying and selling of campus-specific goods and services for the students, faculty, and staff of UHM in a hassle-free and efficient manner. The system enables users to easily search and browse through the available items and create their own listings to sell. Additionally, it comprises user profiles, categorization of different types of items, and a reporting mechanism to flag any inappropriate activity. The ultimate goal is to establish a secure, user-friendly, and productive platform that encourages UHM students to recycle and reuse campus-specific goods and services.
