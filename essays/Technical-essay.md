## My experience of learning Javascript
Javascript is a language I am completely unfamiliar with, but I think it to be pretty simple to master. I found the syntax to be simpler and easier to understand which might be because I have a background in Java, C, and C++. Although I didn't know anything about Javascript before the FreeCodeCamp, I was able to get a strong understanding of a number of fundamental programming concepts, including arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else expressions, classes, etc. In Javascript, the idea of ES6, which added a number of new features and enhancements was one of the things that impressed me the most when I was learning the language. ES6 contained features like template literals, arrow functions, and destructuring, which improved the efficiency and productivity of using Javascript. From my point of view, mastering these new features could be greatly improved the ability to write clean, and readable code.

## Pros and cons of Javascript
From the perspective of software engineering, Javascript is an excellent programming language in my opinion. One of the features I like the most about Javascript is its flexibility. It may be used for both frontend and backend development and can be integrated with other programming languages such as CSS, HTML, etc. Along with all of its advantages, it also has disadvantages. The fact that the syntax does not distinguish between different types of variables when initializing variables, such as int, strings, and doubles, confused me when I was learning Javascript. This can make it slightly more difficult, especially for beginner programmers, to determine what kind of data a variable is holding.

## Athletic software engineering
In ICS 314, one way we learn is through athletic software engineering. WODs(workout of the day) are short assignments with prescribed times for finishing. This kind of training, emphasizes problem-solving and real-world application.Â Although the exercises are supposed to be challenging and stressful, I really find them to be a fun way to learn, as I am a person who would enjoy the process of solving problems. I think this method will be helpful for me because it gives me a chance to apply the knowledge, and it will help me understand and remember it better.
