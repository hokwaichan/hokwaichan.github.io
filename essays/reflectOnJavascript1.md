## My experience of learning Javascript

As a complete newbie to Javascript, I have found the language to be quite easy to learn.  I came from a Java, C, and C++ background, so I found the syntax to be a lot more straightforward and understandable. Despite having no prior knowledge of Javascript, the FreeCodeCamp has allowed me to get a solid understanding of a variety of essential programming concepts, such as arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules. The idea of ES6, which added a number of new features and enhancements to Javascript, was one of the things that particularly stood out to me when I was learning it. It contained features like template literals, arrow functions, and destructuring, which improved the efficiency and productivity of using Javascript. In my opinion, mastering these new features could be greatly improved the ability to write clean, and readable code.

## Pros and cons of Javascript

From the perspective of software engineering, Javascript is an excellent programming language in my opinion. One of the features I like the most about Javascript is its flexibility. It may be used for both frontend and backend development and can be integrated with other programming languages such as CSS, HTML, etc. Along with all of its advantages, it also has disadvantages. The fact that the syntax does not distinguish between different types of variables when initializing variables, such as int, strings, and doubles, confused me when I was learning Javascript. This can make it slightly more difficult, especially for beginner programmers, to determine what kind of data a variable is holding.

## Athletic software engineering

In terms of athletic software engineering, I have found the practice WODs to be really useful. This kind of learning, which focuses on problem-solving and practical application, has allowed me to firmly absorb the material I have learned. Despite the fact that the exercises are meant to be difficult and stressful, I find them to be an enjoyable method to learn. I believe that this approach will be beneficial for me since it enables me to use the knowledge I have learned in an actual scenario, which will improve my ability to understand and remember it.
