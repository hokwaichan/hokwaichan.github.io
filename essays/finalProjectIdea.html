<h3 id="1-overview-including-the-problem-and-the-solution">1. Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)</h3>
<p>The UH Manoa community buys their food either in the food court by the Campus Center or at Paradise Palms. Most of the members of the community do not have enough time to fall in line to order food. There is no existing website where you can order online and pick up the food. So we decided to create a website that will have an interface that allows customers to browse menus, select items, and customize their orders as needed. Customers will be able to pay for their orders online, which will help to speed up the checkout process and reduce wait times. Once an order has been placed and paid for, the website will send a notification to the relevant restaurant, letting them know that a new order has been received. The restaurant will then prepare the order, and the customer will receive a notification when it’s ready for pickup. The website will also include information about pickup locations, hours of operation, and any other relevant details. This information will display on the homepage and other key pages of the site so that customers can easily find what they need. The website will also include user reviews and ratings, as well as information about the restaurants that are featured on the site. This information will help customers make informed decisions about where to order food from.</p>

<p>The Account Registration/Login page is an essential component of your website. A new customer can use this page to create an account and begin ordering food online, while a returning customer can log in to their account to view their order history and place a new order. The Homepage/Landing page can be used to display promotions, as well as reviews. The Restaurant page can include features such as search, feedback, and contact options. Customers can use the search feature to find a specific restaurant or menu item, while feedback options can be used to provide feedback or report an issue with their order. The contact feature can be used to contact the restaurant for additional information or to ask a question. The Confirmation/Checkout page can be used to review the order before checkout and make any necessary changes. The Order tracking page can be used to track the status of the current order and view the order history. Customers can use this page to reorder a previous order or view their receipt or order details for a previous order.</p>
