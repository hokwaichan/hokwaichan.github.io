<h1 id="a-new-language">A new language</h1>
<p>Working with UI frameworks was a challenging task for me as a beginner in the field of web development. Learning these new languages seemed like a difficult task, despite having a rudimentary grasp of UI frameworks and coding expertise in languages like Java, C, and C++. It took a lot of time and effort to become acclimated to it because there were so many classes and syntaxes to understand. But now that I’ve used Bootstrap 5 for a week, I can state with certainty that the time and effort spent learning it was well worth it.</p>

<h1 id="the-advantages">The advantages</h1>
<p>UI frameworks, like Bootstrap 5, offer a variety of advantages that increase the effectiveness and productivity of website construction. It is simple for beginners to build a basic, attractive website using pre-designed themes and classes. It is like having a ready-to-use library of design components at your fingertips, enabling you to quickly compose a website with a clean appearance. Those without design knowledge or skill will find this feature to be extremely useful. Furthermore, responsive design choices provided by bootstrap 5 enable you to build websites that adjust to various screen sizes. For instance, the grid system in Bootstrap 5 may change the layout of a website to accommodate both desktop and mobile interfaces. This function is quite important as the use of mobile devices increases nowadays.</p>

<h1 id="bootstrap-5-or-raw-css">Bootstrap 5 or raw CSS?</h1>
<p>Despite there are many advantages, no doubt bootstrap 5 does present some challenges. Styling certain components, like the navbar, was one of the primary challenges I ran with when using and learning it. The expected outcomes could be obtained, but it took a lot of time and effort to achieve it. Although Bootstrap 5 is very helpful for quickly building simple websites, my perspective is that using raw CSS may be more flexible and simpler to work with.</p>

<h1 id="amazing-experience">Amazing experience</h1>
<p>Overall, my experience with UI frameworks over the past two weeks has been fantastic. Truly, I have had a great time and found it to be quite enjoyable. I have long wanted to create my own website but have never known where to begin. I may now achieve my desire with the power of UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5. Seeing my own creation come to life on the screen gives me a great sense of satisfaction. After this two weeks’ experience, I anticipate continuing my exploration of UI frameworks in the future.</p>
