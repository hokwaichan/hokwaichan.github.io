## Why do we ask questions?
Asking questions is an essential part of being a software engineer. It enables you to understand your problems more thoroughly. But it's crucial to keep in mind that you shouldn't depend on other people to handle all of your difficulties. Make sure you have thought it through or done your research before you ask a question. Sometimes, the problem you are facing might have already been asked or even answered. When asking questions, communication is vital. The answer you get will likely depend a lot on how you word your question. Therefore, it's important to improve your questioning skills.


## A “Smart” question should look like 
When asking for help, it's important to make sure your question is clear and informative. A good question should provide specific details about your problem and include all the necessary information for someone to understand the issue. To make it easy for others to understand, using a meaningful and specific subject header would be helpful. Clearly describes the problem and what's deviating from the expected behavior. Don't forget to include an explicit request for a reply and a way for someone to get in touch with you, such as an email or forum thread. And lastly, be sure to use clear, grammatically correct language and anticipate and answer any questions a helper may have, provide a minimal test case or hint about the problem with code, and be courteous and appreciative of any help provided.


## What about a "Stupid" question?
On the other hand, a question that is poorly written and lacks specifics is bad. Because of this, it might be challenging for someone to comprehend the issue. These kinds of questions may contain exclamation points or expressions like "Please help me," be unclear or unspecific in their topic headings, and waste space in the subject line by detailing their own suffering. They might not even attempt to use their research skills or problem-solving abilities. Instead, they just throw the issue out there and let others handle it.
